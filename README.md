Hi everyone!

My name is Leonardo Colacio Nicolau and I'm a student at FATEC Bauru studying DataBase
I'm just starting to explore the field of Codes and I'm using GitHub to share my learnings and work.

Here you will find:
My personal projects: projects that I'm developing for fun or to learn new skills.
My academic work: work that I've completed during my academic career.
My study repositories: repositories that I'm using to study new technologies or concepts.

I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new ways to learn. If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
